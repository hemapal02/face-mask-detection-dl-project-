🧠😷 Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning

This project is all about detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not using Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Super useful during times like COVID-19, or even just for fun if you want to learn image classification!

📌 What is this project? We trained a deep learning model to look at people's faces in images (or webcam/video) and decide:

😷 "Mask" – if the person is wearing a mask

😶 "No Mask" – if the person is not wearing a mask

🧰 Tools and Technologies Used Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras 📚

OpenCV 🎥 (for webcam & image processing)

NumPy + Matplotlib (for handling and plotting data)
